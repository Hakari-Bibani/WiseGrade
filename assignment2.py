            ### Objective
            In this assignment, you will analyze real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API. You will filter earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0, plot their locations on a map, and calculate statistics about the data.

            ### Assignment: Week 2 ‚Äì Earthquake Data Analysis
            **Objective:**
            - Fetch earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API for a specified date range.
            - Filter earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0.
            - Plot the earthquake locations on an interactive map.
            - Calculate and display statistics about the earthquakes.

            **Task Requirements:**
            1. **Fetch Earthquake Data:**
               - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for the date range January 2nd, 2025, to January 9th, 2025.
               - The data should include latitude, longitude, magnitude, and time.

            2. **Filter Earthquakes:**
               - Filter the data to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0.

            3. **Map Visualization:**
               - Plot the filtered earthquake locations on an interactive map using `folium`.
               - Use color-coded markers based on magnitude:
                 - Green: 4.0-5.0
                 - Yellow: 5.0-5.5
                 - Red: 5.5+
               - Add popups to display additional information (magnitude, location, and time).

            4. **Statistics and Bar Chart:**
               - Calculate the number of earthquakes in the following magnitude ranges:
                 - 4.0-4.5
                 - 4.5-5.0
                 - 5.0+
               - Generate a bar chart to visualize the frequency of earthquakes in each range.
               - Provide a text summary with:
                 - Total number of earthquakes with magnitude > 4.0.
                 - Average, maximum, and minimum magnitudes.
                 - Number of earthquakes in each magnitude range.

            **Expected Output:**
            1. A map showing earthquake locations.
            2. A bar chart showing earthquake frequency by magnitude range.
            3. A text summary of earthquake statistics.
