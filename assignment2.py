            **In this assignment**, you will write a Python script that fetches real-time earthquake data 
            from the USGS Earthquake API, processes the data to filter earthquakes with a magnitude greater 
            than 4.0, and plots the earthquake locations on a map. Additionally, you will calculate the number 
            of earthquakes in different magnitude ranges and present the results visually.
            
            **Maybe you need this API**: [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/).

            **API URL**:
            ```
            https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=YYYY-MM-DD&endtime=YYYY-MM-DD
            ```
            Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the appropriate dates.

            ### Task Requirements
            - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for **January 2nd, 2025, to January 9th, 2025**.
            - Filter data to include only **earthquakes with magnitude > 4.0**.
            - Create an **interactive map** showing locations of the filtered earthquakes:
                - Markers with **different colors** based on magnitude:
                  - Green for magnitude 4‚Äì5
                  - Yellow for magnitude 5‚Äì5.5
                  - Red for magnitude 5.5+
                - Popups to display magnitude, location, and time.
            - Create a **bar chart** (PNG) showing earthquake frequency by magnitude range:
              - 4.0‚Äì4.5
              - 4.5‚Äì5.0
              - > 5.0
            - Provide a **text summary** (CSV) with:
              - Total number of earthquakes with magnitude > 4.0
              - Average, maximum, and minimum magnitudes
              - Count of earthquakes in each magnitude range
