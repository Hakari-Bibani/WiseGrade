            ### Objective
            In this assignment, you will write a Python script that fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API, processes the data to filter earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0, and plots the earthquake locations on a map. Additionally, you will calculate the number of earthquakes in different magnitude ranges and present the results visually.

            ### Task Requirements
            - **Fetch Earthquake Data**:
                - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for the date range **January 2nd, 2025, to January 9th, 2025**.
                - The API URL is:  
                  `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=YYYY-MM-DD&endtime=YYYY-MM-DD`.  
                  Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the appropriate dates.
            - **Filter Data**:
                - Filter the data to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0.
            - **Map Visualization**:
                - Create an interactive map using `folium` to show the locations of the filtered earthquakes.
                - Mark the earthquake locations with markers, using different colors based on their magnitude:
                    - **Green** for magnitude 4.0-5.0
                    - **Yellow** for magnitude 5.0-5.5
                    - **Red** for magnitude 5.5+
                - Add popups to display additional information about each earthquake (magnitude, location, and time).
            - **Bar Chart**:
                - Create a bar chart using `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to visualize earthquake frequency by magnitude, within the following ranges:
                    - 4.0-4.5
                    - 4.5-5.0
                    - 5.0+
            - **Text Summary**:
                - Generate a CSV file containing:
                    - Total number of earthquakes with magnitude > 4.0.
                    - Average, maximum, and minimum magnitudes (rounded to 2 decimal places).
                    - Number of earthquakes in each magnitude range (4.0-4.5, 4.5-5.0, 5.0+).
            ### Python Libraries You Will Use
            - `folium` for the map.
            - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for the bar chart.
            - `requests` or `urllib` for API calls.
            - `pandas` for data processing.
            ### Expected Output
            1. A map showing earthquake locations.
            2. A bar chart showing earthquake frequency by magnitude.
            3. A text summary in CSV format.
