            ### Objective
            In this assignment, you will write a Python script that fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API, processes the data to filter earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0, and plots the earthquake locations on a map. Additionally, you will calculate the number of earthquakes in different magnitude ranges and present the results visually.

            ### Task Requirements
            - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for the date range **January 2nd, 2025, to January 9th, 2025**.
            - Filter the data to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0.
            - Create an interactive map that shows the locations of the filtered earthquakes.
            - Mark the earthquake locations on the map with markers, using different colors based on their magnitude:
                - **Green** for magnitude 4.0-4.5
                - **Yellow** for magnitude 4.5-5.0
                - **Red** for magnitude greater than 5.0
            - Add popups to display additional information about each earthquake (magnitude, location, and time).
            - Create a bar chart visualizing earthquake frequency by magnitude range:
                - 4.0-4.5
                - 4.5-5.0
                - Greater than 5.0
            - Generate a text summary as a CSV file containing:
                - Total number of earthquakes with magnitude > 4.0.
                - Average, maximum, and minimum magnitudes.
                - Number of earthquakes in each magnitude range.

            ### Python Libraries You Will Use
            - `folium` for the map.
            - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for the bar chart.
            - `requests` or `urllib` for API calls.
            - `pandas` for data processing.

            ### Expected Output
            1. An interactive map showing earthquake locations.
            2. A bar chart visualizing earthquake frequency.
            3. A text summary (in CSV format).
