    ### Objective
    In this assignment, you will write a Python script to plot three geographical coordinates on a map and calculate the distance between each pair of points in kilometers. This will help you practice working with geospatial data and Python libraries for mapping and calculations.

    ### Assignment: Week 1 â€“ Mapping Coordinates and Calculating Distances in Python
    **Objective:**
    In this assignment, you will write a Python script to plot three geographical coordinates on a map and calculate the distance between each pair of points in kilometers. This will help you practice working with geospatial data and Python libraries for mapping and calculations.

    **Task Requirements:**
    1. **Plot the Three Coordinates on a Map:**
       - The coordinates represent three locations in the Kurdistan Region.
       - You will use Python libraries to plot these points on a map.
       - The map should visually display the exact locations of the coordinates.

    2. **Calculate the Distance Between Each Pair of Points:**
       - You will calculate the distances between the three points in kilometers.
       - Specifically, calculate:
         - The distance between Point 1 and Point 2.
         - The distance between Point 2 and Point 3.
         - The distance between Point 1 and Point 3.
       - Add Markers to the map for each coordinate.
       - Add polylines to connect the points.
       - Add popups to display information about the distance.

    **Coordinates:**
    - Point 1: Latitude: 36.325735, Longitude: 43.928414
    - Point 2: Latitude: 36.393432, Longitude: 44.586781
    - Point 3: Latitude: 36.660477, Longitude: 43.840174

    **Python Libraries You Will Use:**
    - `geopy` for calculating the distance between two coordinates.
    - `folium` for plotting the points on an interactive map.
    - `pandas` to create a DataFrame that displays the distances between the points.

    **Expected Output:**
    1. A map showing the three coordinates.
    2. A text summary (Express values to two decimal places.): showing the calculated distances (in kilometers) between:
       - Point 1 and Point 2.
       - Point 2 and Point 3.
       - Point 1 and Point 3.

    ### Detailed Grading Breakdown

    #### 1. Code Structure and Implementation (30 points)
    - **Library Imports (5 points):**
        - Checks if the required libraries (`folium`, `geopy`, `geodesic`) are imported.
    - **Coordinate Handling (5 points):**
        - Checks if the correct coordinates are defined in the code.
    - **Code Execution (10 points):**
        - Checks if the code runs without errors.
    - **Code Quality (10 points):**
        - **Variable Naming:** 2 points (deducted if single-letter variables are used).
        - **Spacing:** 2 points (deducted if improper spacing is found, e.g., no space after `=`).
        - **Comments:** 2 points (deducted if no comments are present).
        - **Code Organization:** 2 points (deducted if no blank lines are used for separation).
