                #### Instructions:
                1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
                   - Open a new Google Colab notebook.
                   - Import the necessary libraries:
                     - `cv2` (OpenCV) for image processing.
                     - `numpy` for numerical operations.
                     - `matplotlib` for displaying images.

                2. **Load the Image:**
                   - Download the provided image and upload it to Google Colab.
                   - Load the image using OpenCV.

                3. **Convert the Image to Grayscale and Apply Thresholding:**
                   - Convert the image to grayscale.
                   - Use binary thresholding to make it easier to detect the rectangular shapes. This will turn the rectangles into clear white shapes against a black background.

                4. **Detect Contours:**
                   - Use OpenCV‚Äôs `findContours` function to detect all contours in the image.
                   - Filter out contours that are not rectangular shapes.

                5. **Filter and Identify Rectangles:**
                   - For each contour, approximate its shape using `cv2.approxPolyDP`.
                   - If the contour has four points, consider it a rectangle.
                   - Calculate the bounding box coordinates of each rectangle using `cv2.boundingRect`.

                6. **Extract and Print the Coordinates:**
                   - For each detected rectangle, print the top-left and bottom-right coordinates.
                   - Display the original image with the rectangles outlined for verification.

                1. **Library Imports (20 Points)**
                   - Checks if the required libraries are imported correctly.

                2. **Code Quality (20 Points)**
                   - **Descriptive Variable Names (5 Points):**
                     - Deducted if non-descriptive variable names are used (e.g., x, y).
                   - **Spacing and Indentation (5 Points):**
                     - Deducted if improper spacing or indentation is found.
                   - **Comments (5 Points):**
                     - Deducted if no comments are present to explain major steps.
                   - **Code Organization (5 Points):**
                     - Deducted if code blocks are not logically separated with blank lines or functions.

                3. **Rectangle Coordinates (30 Points)**
                   - You can paste them as (for instance):
                     ```
                     Rectangle 1: Top-Left (1678, 1705), Bottom-Right (8061, 7612)
                     Rectangle 2: Top-Left (459, 9805), Bottom-Right (728, 6712)
                     ```
                   - Or:
                     ```
                     (1374, 1605), (7878, 3705), (9678, 4705), (4608, 3705), ‚Ä¶.
                     ```

                4. **Upload Thresholded Image (15 Points):**
                   - Upload file as PNG.

                5. **Upload Image with Rectangles Outlined (15 Points):**
                   - Upload file as PNG.
