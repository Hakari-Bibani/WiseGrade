            1. Import required libraries:
                - OpenCV (cv2) / Pillow (PIL) / Scikit-Image / ImageAI
                - NumPy / SciPy / TensorFlow / PyTorch
                - Matplotlib / Plotly / Seaborn / Pillow
                
            2. Code Quality:
                - Use descriptive variable names
                - Maintain proper spacing
                - Include comments explaining major steps
                - Organize code with logical separation
                
            3. Rectangle Detection:
                - Detect and outline 14 rectangles in the provided image
                - Provide accurate coordinates for each rectangle
                
            4. Image Processing:
                - Submit a properly thresholded image
                - Submit an image with correctly outlined rectangles
