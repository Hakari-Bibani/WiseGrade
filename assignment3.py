            ### Objective
            In this assignment, students will work with geographical temperature data and apply Python programming to perform data manipulation and visualization. The task is broken into three stages, with each stage encapsulating a specific function. By the end of the assignment, students will merge the functions into one script to complete the task efficiently.

            ### Stage 1: Filtering Data Below 25¬∞C
            **Goal**: Create a new tab in the spreadsheet containing only the data points where the temperature is below 25¬∞C.
            **Instructions**:
            - Load the provided Excel file containing longitude, latitude, and temperature data.
            - Write a Python script that filters out all the rows where the temperature is below 25¬∞C.
            - Save this filtered data in a new sheet within the same Excel file, naming the new sheet "Below_25".
            **Deliverable**: A script that filters and saves the data in the "Below_25" tab of the Excel file.

            ### Stage 2: Filtering Data Above 25¬∞C
            **Goal**: Create another tab in the spreadsheet containing only the data points where the temperature is above 25¬∞C.
            **Instructions**:
            - Extend your script to filter out all the rows where the temperature is above 25¬∞C.
            - Save this filtered data in a new sheet named "Above_25".
            **Deliverable**: A script that adds the "Above_25" tab to the Excel file.

            ### Stage 3: Visualizing Data on a Map
            **Goal**: Visualize the data points from both the "Below_25" and "Above_25" tabs on a geographical map.
            **Instructions**:
            - Using a Python mapping library (such as folium, matplotlib, or plotly), plot the data points from both the "Below_25" and "Above_25" tabs.
            - Use blue to represent the data points from the "Below_25" tab and red for the "Above_25" tab.
            - Ensure the map accurately displays the temperature data at the correct coordinates.
            **Deliverable**: A Python script that generates a map displaying the data points in blue and red.

            ### Final Task: Merging the Scripts
            **Goal**: Combine all three stages into one cohesive Python script that performs the filtering and visualization tasks in sequence.
            **Instructions**:
            - Encapsulate the functionality of the three scripts (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3) into distinct functions.
            - Write a master function that calls these functions in sequence:
                1. First, filter the data below 25¬∞C and save it to a new tab.
                2. Then, filter the data above 25¬∞C and save it to another tab.
                3. Finally, visualize both sets of data on a map.
            - Ensure that the final script runs all the steps seamlessly.
            **Deliverable**: A Python script that completes the entire task, from filtering the data to visualizing it on a map.
