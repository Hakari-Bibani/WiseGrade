            ### Objective
            In this assignment, you will extend your earthquake data analysis from Assignment 2.
            You will fetch real-time earthquake data, perform advanced filtering, and create interactive visualizations.
            Additionally, you will analyze trends and generate a report.

            ### Task Requirements
            - **Fetch Earthquake Data**:
                - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for the date range **January 10th, 2025, to January 17th, 2025**.
                - The API URL is:  
                  `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=YYYY-MM-DD&endtime=YYYY-MM-DD`.
            - **Advanced Filtering**:
                - Filter the data to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
            - **Interactive Map**:
                - Create an interactive map using `folium` to show the locations of the filtered earthquakes.
                - Use custom icons for markers based on magnitude ranges.
            - **Trend Analysis**:
                - Generate a line chart showing the frequency of earthquakes over time.
            - **Report Generation**:
                - Create a PDF report summarizing your analysis.
            ### Python Libraries You Will Use
            - `folium` for the map.
            - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for the line chart.
            - `requests` or `urllib` for API calls.
            - `pandas` for data processing.
            - `reportlab` for PDF generation.
            ### Expected Output
            1. An interactive map showing earthquake locations.
            2. A line chart showing earthquake frequency over time.
            3. A PDF report summarizing your analysis.

            - Checks for the correct API URL and successful data retrieval.
            #### 4. Encapsulate Functionality (5 Points)
            - Checks if the functionality is encapsulated into distinct functions (`stage_1`, `stage_2`, `stage_3`).
            #### 5. Filter Data Below 25¬∞C (5 Points)
            - Checks for filtering data where temperature is below 25¬∞C.
            #### 6. Filter Data Above 25¬∞C (5 Points)
            - Checks for filtering data where temperature is above 25¬∞C.
            #### 7. HTML File (15 Points)
            - Checks for markers (e.g., `marker` or `circle-marker`) and the presence of colors green and red.
