            In this assignment, you will extend your earthquake data analysis from Assignment 2. You will fetch real-time earthquake data, perform advanced filtering, and create interactive visualizations. Additionally, you will analyze trends and generate a report.

            ### Task Requirements
            - **Fetch Earthquake Data**:
                - Use the USGS Earthquake API to fetch data for the date range **January 10th, 2025, to January 17th, 2025**.
                - The API URL is:  
                  `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=YYYY-MM-DD&endtime=YYYY-MM-DD`.  
                  Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the appropriate dates.
            - **Advanced Filtering**:
                - Filter the data to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
            - **Interactive Map**:
                - Create an interactive map using `folium` to show the locations of the filtered earthquakes.
                - Use custom icons for markers based on magnitude ranges.
            - **Trend Analysis**:
                - Generate a line chart showing the frequency of earthquakes over time.
            - **Report Generation**:
                - Create a PDF report summarizing your findings.
            ### Python Libraries You Will Use
            - `folium` (or `plotly`, `geopandas`, or `matplotlib` with mapping extensions) for the map.
            - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for the line chart.
            - `requests` or `urllib` for API calls.
            - `pandas` or `numpy` for data processing.
            - `reportlab` for PDF generation.
            - Additionally, a library for Google Sheets such as `gspread`, `pygsheets`, or `google-api-python-client`.
            ### Expected Output
            1. An interactive map showing earthquake locations.
            2. A line chart showing earthquake frequency over time.
            3. A PDF report summarizing your analysis.
            4. Two filtered Excel sheets: one for data below 25¬∞C (labeled "Below_25") and one for data above 25¬∞C (labeled "Above_25").
